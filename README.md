# FotmobWebscraping
Code to Webscrape the famous football stats website FOTMOB. The result will be 4 tables in Excel.
# To begin with, I do not intend to generate revenue with the data I am able to scrape. 
# I just want some data in order to publish some insights I may find relevant about football and mainly to kickstart my career as a Data Scientist/Analyst in football.

# Here I will be publishing the code I built in order to webscrape 4 Excel tables with various data.
